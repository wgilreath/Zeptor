  Description: This program implements a check if a given year as integer as 
               input and determines if it is a leap year. the rules of leap 
               years: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it 
               is divisible by 100. If a year is divisible by 100 and also 
               divisible by 400, then it is considered a leap year.
