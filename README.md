# Zeptor: The ZeptoN Code Editor

Zeptor is a simple code editor, an integrated development environment (IDE) that has the look and feel of the old style Turbo Editor/Pascal on DOS. The programming language that Zeptor was created for, ZeptoN (although Zeptor can be adapted for other programming languages with some work...ðŸ˜œ) is primarily a learning language. Therefore, Zeptor is deliberately simple, and avoiding all the features of a full scale IDE with many bells, whistles, whips and chains.

Using a metaphor, when learning to fly an airplane, an instructor would not take a student to the flight deck or cockpit of a large jetliner. Learning to write code should not be learning the tool and the idiosyncrasies of the tool to learn the programming language. The sophisticated complex IDEs are great for a seasoned professional, but not a student. Hence Zeptor to learn to program with ZeptoN. 

ZeptoN is also useful to do a quick-and-dirty prototype of something in software, avoiding the need to create a class with a super-class, constructor, attributes, design patterns, SOLID principles--all that fun stuff and great things in the object-oriented paradigm. With ZeptoN you create a program, and then go from there, focus on what you are trying to write in code.
