  Name: pi314159265359.zept

  Description: Pi computed by Taylor Series from the Wired magazine article: 
               "6 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Pi," March 14, 2016, 
               https://www.wired.com/2016/03/six-things-probably-didnt-know-pi/ 
               by Rhett Allain. 

               Use a finite limit of an infinite Taylor series to approximate pi, 
               and compute difference with java Math.PI constant.
